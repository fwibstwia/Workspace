From this course, first I want to learn some basics about model
checking and program verification, like how to establish formal
models for a given program and use model checking tools to verify
that these models have certain properties. Also I want to know
the current status of model checking field, like the research
problems people are currently working on. It seems that this
week's talk "Lightweight Formal Methods for LLVM Verification" is
similar with the model checking. He first established some model
and verified that these models have certain properties with the
help of SMT solver, and automatically generated c++ codes based
on these models. About the last step, I want to know whether
there are similar techniques in the model checking field. 

Another aspect I want to learn is the theory behind model
checking, like automata theory and temporal logic.

I prefer to do some projects using model checking tools to verify
some non-trivial programs.
