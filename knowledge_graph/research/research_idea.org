* Floating Point
  - The kind of floating point inputs which will show significant
    deviation will be clustered within a close set of values. 
  - The scope of "error inputs" may be decided by the predicate.  
  - Estimating the error may be used to estimate the numerical scope
    of different addition order.
  - The order of input number have an influence for the final result.
  - the operations of floating point multiplication and division do
    not magnify the relative error by very much; but floating point
    subtraction of nearly equal quantities (and floating point
    addition, u $ 21, where u is nearly equal to -V) can very greatly
    increase the relative error.
  - Sources of floating point arithmetic error - overflows,
    underflows, and accumulated rounding errors.
  - Two approaches for precision estimation:
    - static analysis: Gappa, SmartFloat, SMT
    - combine symbolic techniques and heuristics
  - Padding constant to handle the case that the exact value is 0 and
    we cannot compute the relative error in that situation.
  - Use fast2Sum to get more accurate error bound.
