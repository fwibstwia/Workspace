This code trains a single logistic neuron.
It uses a squared error loss function on the outputs of the logistic unit.

To create some data -
> make_data;

To learn a neuron on it -
 > learn_neuron;

For mnist 2s and 3s data -
> load mnist_2_3
> learn_neuron;

To look at any data point i in the mnist data -
> imagesc(reshape(data(i, :), 28, 28)');
